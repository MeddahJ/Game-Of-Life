Game-Of-Life-LambdaJ
====================

[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) without conditional statements, loops, long methods or a fancy functional language.

It started from a [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org) iteration with those restrictions, and ended up as an occasion to test [lambdaj](https://code.google.com/p/lambdaj) a little more (and find some issues).
