Game-Of-Life-LambdaJ
====================

Conway's Game of Life without conditional statements, loops, long methods or a fancy functional language

It started from a [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org) iteration where I didn't delete my code, where no loops nor conditional statements were allowed. A nice exercise where I could test [lambdaj](https://code.google.com/p/lambdaj) a little more (and to file a couple of issues)
